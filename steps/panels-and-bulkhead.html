Realize that you probably should’ve glued it with sikaflex, so you glue it with sikaflex - on top of the holes. This just makes the leaking problem permanent. Wait until your neighbor takes an interest and puts a nut + bolt on it saving the day. Clean the van. You probably should’ve done this sooner. Take the bulkhead out. Many of the screws are easy enough to take out, but some of them prove to be incredibly stubborn. Give up and hope your neighbor takes an interest as he knows much more than you about this stuff. Start to realize this neighbor has saved the day too many times but struggle figuring out how to repay him. Fill all cavities with as much insulation as you can, the wooly stuff. Wonder if it’s enough, but never really know. Put sound deadening on. Wonder what they’re for and realize you’ll never really know." />
