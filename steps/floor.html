<meta name="description" content="Use paper to try and come up with a template for your van flooring. Stick them together with some gaffer tape and, while it’s apparently snowing and blowing up a storm, attempt to take this huge fragile template into your flat across the street, up the stairs, through the flat itself, then down the spiral staircase into the garden. It’ll be fine. Take your giant 165cmx122cm piece of plywood (your floor) and try to shimmy it free from the ridiculous place you put it in. Your neighbor’s child will come in and try to assist, he’s amazing company but seven years old and more of a moral support. With the neighbour’s kid, attempt to pivot around the flat to the spiral staircase. Tell the kid to get far away and act as a lookout as it suddenly crosses your mind that if you hurt the kid the neighbor might not help anymore. Take the giant piece of wood and angle it over the top of the staircase while your partner frantically runs to the bottom of the staircase as you barely hold onto it on your own to catch it at the bottom. The kid recently learned about gravity, and encourages us to just drop it. Don’t listen to the kid. When the inevitable storm hits, run around your garden frantically and put a tarp over your wood and (precious) template. Find objects around the garden to keep the tarp down in the wind. Things lying around, like a cement bust of a sheep (for whatever reason). After the storm clears, unwrap your wood and try and draw the template that has blown around in the wind. The minute you align one side, the other comes up in the wind, and the minute you align the other side, the middle comes up (as the template is like 50 pieces of paper). Wrestle it down by having you lie on top of it while your partner quickly draws around it between gusts of wind. Lift the wood onto some surface that’ll allow you to cut through it with a jigsaw. The minute before you do so, the neighbor’s cat will go under your plywood and sort of sit there for no reason. Attempt to scare the cat off but realize that you just need to wait. Cut out the shapes you need, but realize that there’s some ambiguity in the drawing. Cut anyway, life is short. Carry the cut wood up the spiral garden staircase, through the flat, down the staircase, across the street into the van. Attempt to put it in the van but it doesn’t fit. Do some improvisational cuts until it does. Realize you’ve only done 1/3 of the van floor. Rinse and repeat step 18-24 two more absurd times." />
