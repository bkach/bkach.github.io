You choose over, but you spend way too long agonising over the decision. Cut your batons, but realize that they don’t fit where you measured really. Try to sand them down, but realize that won’t work. In the street just saw pieces off until they sort of fit. Put thick insulation on the wheel arches. Marvel at the fact this was easy enough to do. Glue your batons, and use “No More Nails” adhesive. Realize that you should’ve used sikaflex and say fuck it and just go with it anyway. Notice that the batons you put in the step sort of don’t stick anymore, but conclude that step is always going to make a sound like that and you’re fine with it. Put insulation between the batons. Begin by using the think insulation, but give up quickly. Go to the shop, get the shitty stuff that’s easy to cut, and get some more insulating tape. The tape is inexplicably over £16 but you’re too tired to do anything about it at this point. Some of the batons may just come un-stuck. Wonder if you should’ve used sikaflex but whatever. Glue them back on" />
