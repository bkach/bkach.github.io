<div id="Preparing the van" />

<h2 id="preparing-the-van">Preparing the van</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Find cheap van. Wait like four months for a good deal.</li>
  <li>Get a parking permit, insurance, MOT, Tax etc. and regret buying a vehicle</li>
  <li>Get a mechanic to look at it. Preferably if you don’t understand what they’re saying.</li>
  <li>Rip out all the wood paneling on the van and realize that you probably should’ve kept it to make a template out of. Conclude it’s fine, how difficult could it be?</li>
  <li>Take out all the screws and other bits of metal in the van and realize you now have a bunch of holes in your van to the outside. Panic, and find some way to fill them.</li>
  <li>Strip off any rusty bits with steel wool and paint over them. Preferably in a barn.</li>
</ul>

<div id="Panels and bulkhead" />

<h2 id="panels-and-bulkhead">Panels and bulkhead</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Put the solar panel on the roof. Screw into your van, and when it rains watch as the water goes through those holes your just screwed. Realize that you probably should’ve glued it with sikaflex, so you glue it with sikaflex - on top of the holes. This just makes the leaking problem permanent. Wait until your neighbor takes an interest and puts a nut + bolt on it saving the day.</li>
  <li>Clean the van. You probably should’ve done this sooner.</li>
  <li>Take the bulkhead out. Many of the screws are easy enough to take out, but some of them prove to be incredibly stubborn. Give up and hope your neighbor takes an interest as he knows much more than you about this stuff. Start to realize this neighbor has saved the day too many times but struggle figuring out how to repay him.</li>
  <li>Get insulation from your partner’s sister’s partner somewhere in Cirencister. All three of your partners’ siblings have successfully
built vans. Good luck.</li>
  <li>Fill all cavities with as much insulation as you can, the wooly stuff. Wonder if it’s enough, but never really know.</li>
  <li>Put sound deadening on. Wonder what they’re for and realize you’ll never really know.</li>
</ul>

<div id="Batons" />

<h2 id="batons">Batons</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Measure your van for the batons. Realize that the bottom of the van is wavy for no fucking reason and you can either put your batons over or under the waves. You choose over, but you spend way too long agonising over the decision.</li>
  <li>Cut your batons, but realize that they don’t fit where you measured really. Try to sand them down, but realize that won’t work. In the street just saw pieces off until they sort of fit.</li>
  <li>Put thick insulation on the wheel arches. Marvel at the fact this was easy enough to do.</li>
  <li>Glue your batons, and use “No More Nails” adhesive. Realize that you should’ve used sikaflex and say fuck it and just go with it anyway. Notice that the batons you put in the step sort of don’t stick anymore, but conclude that step is always going to make a sound like that and you’re fine with it.</li>
  <li>Put insulation between the batons. Begin by using the think insulation, but give up quickly. Go to the shop, get the shitty stuff that’s easy to cut, and get some more insulating tape. The tape is inexplicably over £16 but you’re too tired to do anything about it at this point.</li>
  <li>Some of the batons may just come un-stuck. Wonder if you should’ve used sikaflex but whatever. Glue them back on</li>
</ul>

<div id="Floor" />

<h2 id="floor">Floor</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use paper to try and come up with a template for your van flooring. Stick them together with some gaffer tape and, while it’s apparently snowing and blowing up a storm, attempt to take this huge fragile template into your flat across the street, up the stairs, through the flat itself, then down the spiral staircase into the garden. It’ll be fine.</li>
  <li>Take your giant 165cmx122cm piece of plywood (your floor) and try to shimmy it free from the ridiculous place you put it in. Your neighbor’s child will come in and try to assist, he’s amazing company but seven years old and more of a moral support. With the neighbour’s kid, attempt to pivot around the flat to the spiral staircase. Tell the kid to get far away and act as a lookout as it suddenly crosses your mind that if you hurt the kid the neighbor might not help anymore. Take the giant piece of wood and angle it over the top of the staircase while your partner frantically runs to the bottom of the staircase as you barely hold onto it on your own to catch it at the bottom. The kid recently learned about gravity, and encourages us to just drop it. Don’t listen to the kid.</li>
  <li>When the inevitable storm hits, run around your garden frantically and put a tarp over your wood and (precious) template. Find objects around the garden to keep the tarp down in the wind. Things lying around, like a cement bust of a sheep (for whatever reason).</li>
  <li>After the storm clears, unwrap your wood and try and draw the template that has blown around in the wind. The minute you align one side, the other comes up in the wind, and the minute you align the other side, the middle comes up (as the template is like 50 pieces of paper). Wrestle it down by having you lie on top of it while your partner quickly draws around it between gusts of wind.</li>
  <li>Lift the wood onto some surface that’ll allow you to cut through it with a jigsaw. The minute before you do so, the neighbor’s cat will go under your plywood and sort of sit there for no reason. Attempt to scare the cat off but realize that you just need to wait.</li>
  <li>Cut out the shapes you need, but realize that there’s some ambiguity in the drawing. Cut anyway, life is short.</li>
  <li>Carry the cut wood up the spiral garden staircase, through the flat, down the staircase, across the street into the van. Attempt to put it in the van but it doesn’t fit. Do some improvisational cuts until it does.</li>
  <li>Realize you’ve only done 1/3 of the van floor. Rinse and repeat step 18-24 two more absurd times.</li>
</ul>

<div id="Electrics research" />

<h2 id="electrics-research">Electrics research</h2>
<p><img src="../pics/fine.png" width="100" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Research electrics and <a href="/electrics/#dangers">realize it could kill you</a>. 
This involves trolling the internet for ridiculous van builds by people 
with way too much time and money on their hands, asking questions 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/ts2gd8/wiring_ordering/i2pez2u/?context=3">getting the worst answers</a>
, and finally drawing up some kind of electrics diagram. Post it on the 
internet and see hundreds of people shit on it. Post it again. 
Rinse and repeat until you’re fairly certain you won’t kill yourself 
and your significant other. Congrats, you’ve earned the right to buy 
one grand worth of kit for a fridge and phone charger.</li>
  <li>Question whether it’s worth it, but revel in the fact 
that you’re getting “free energy”. That’s (of course) once you learn 
to strip and crimp wires, size fuses properly, read every manual for 
every piece of equipment you were told to buy, and invariably realize 
you’re missing something.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="if-youre-keen-on-the-details">If you’re keen on the details:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Research current, voltage, resistance, power, conductivity, kirchkoff’s 
laws, ohm’s law, voltage drop, parallel vs series wiring, DC vs AC, AC ripple,
lead acid vs lithium ion, Battery management systems, breakers, switches,
all the different types of fuses, battery balancing, bus bars, shunts, charge
controllers, solar panels, ground, earth, grounding to the chassis, voltage
drop, and probably more.</li>
  <li>Decide that you’ll go for a simple 12V system unless you’re insane.</li>
  <li>Research wires:
    <ul>
      <li>Wires come in different gauges which mean sizes. The thicker the wire,
the more amperage it can handle without melting and possibly killing 
you and your loved ones. The thicker the wire the more expensive it is,
killing you and your loved ones in a completely separate manner.</li>
      <li>If the wire is too long, you might lose some voltage unnecessarily.</li>
      <li>The American Wire Gauge (AWG) system unintuitively starts from 0000 
(known as (4/0)) to (3/0) to (2/0) (1/0) then 1, 2, 3 and so on. As 
the zeroes get smaller and the numbers get larger it means the wires get <em>thinner</em>.
i.e. (4/0) is super thick and 12 is thinner.</li>
      <li>Not everyone uses that system, and here in the UK they are open minded
enough to use several measurements at the same time. Along with AWG there are two other
types of measurements: the diameter of the wire (in mm) and 
the area of a cross section of the uninsulated part of the wire (in mm<sup>2</sup>).</li>
      <li>As is probably expected, the mm<sup>2</sup>, mm, and AWG measurements never
line up. Case in point - I have some 6mm<sup>2</sup> wire. That’s between 9AWG 
(6.6342mm<sup>2</sup>) and 10AWG (5.2612mm<sup>2</sup>). I’m either .63
off or .73 off depending on which I choose. Wonderful.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Research how wires connect to one another
    <ul>
      <li>To connect two wires, you need to strip the ends first. Wire strippers seem to
be easy enough to find, but once you go past 10AWG things start to get
expensive. You can get some fancy automatic strippers or just use a knife.
If you will buy something, make sure it works for the gauge wire you’re working on,
otherwise you’ll be subject to battery megastore’s horrible return policy.</li>
      <li>Learn that if you strip your wires incorrectly you’ll lose some conductivity
as each wire is made up of a bunch of other tiny little wires and you need to
make sure they’re all intact.</li>
      <li>You then have bare wire ends you need to connect to something. You probably
need to get a crimper. A crimper smushes something to the end of your bare
wire which will help it connect to something else. Make sure the crimper 
works for the gauge wire you’re working on (as the aforementioned return
policy adds quite a few steps I’ve chosen to leave out).</li>
      <li>Ready to connect two things together? Hold your horses there friend.
What are you connecting to?
        <ul>
          <li>Connecting to another wire? Solder them if you want, but since
you don’t know how to do that - you probably want to crimp them together
with a butt connector. Don’t laugh, that’s what it’s called.</li>
          <li>Connecting to a bolt? You’ll need a cable eye lug, washer, spring and nut.
You’ll also need to tighten at the exact pressure the manufacturers ask for.
You don’t have tools for that, so you’ll need to estimate. Also all bolts are
not made equal. They size bolts as M8, M7 similar to the AWG except
the M’s are the european ones and the exact measurements are american this time.
Also, unlike AWG as the M’s go up in number as the bolts get bigger. Go figure. Depending 
on who you ask, you’ll get the M number, millimeters, or inches. If you do get inches,
the inches will be given to you as a fraction of an inch instead of a decimal in order to make things fun for you
when you look at conversion tables and realize you need a calculator just to read them.
Another way these can also be described (in the US) is with dashes like “10-32”. 10 as a size designator
with no meaning, and 32 as the 32 thread pitch in threads per inch. Obviously they
don’t match, as evidienced by this entire webpage dedicated to answering what the metric
<a href="https://www.rampfesthudson.com/what-is-the-metric-equivalent-of-10-32-screw/">equivalent of a 10-32 bolt is</a>. Fascinating.</li>
          <li>Connecting to a screw connector? Strip some of the wires and screw them in. If you
want to make it nice, use ferrules. But you’ll need a separate crimping tool just for that.
Make sure you buy them by the thousand even if you only need one as that’s apparently the
only way to get them.</li>
          <li>Connecting to a spade? Crimp a spade connector to it. You’ll probably need only like
two of these, but you’ll have to buy them by the ton.</li>
          <li>Connecting to solar? Use the MC4 connectors. They’re the best kind of connection type, 
just plug and play.
That is unless they get stuck and you have to take them apart. Then they’re the worst kind
of connection type. Spend about an hour on your roof trying to get one off with 
a screwdriver. When it finally comes off - scramble to make sure the positive and negative
wires don’t touch as you forget which is which. That was a good day.</li>
          <li>There’s more, probably.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Done crimping? Perfect - now you need to put an insulating “sock” on your connection which
heat shrinks around your wire and the connector in order to insulate it. You can use a bic
lighter to heat it up which is kinda cool i guess, but if you burn it you won’t be able to
tell if your burn is because you burned it while trying to heat shrink it or it’s burining
because the wire it’s insulating is getting hot. Good luck!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Try and go to any local hardware store for the components but realize that electrics is
something that no store really does anymore. You’ll need to go to amazon and buy 1200 of every
tiny component you need three of.</li>
  <li>You can still do this right?</li>
</ul>

<p>More steps coming soon!</p>
